## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Excluded `test/` and `tool/` from the published package, reducing the archive from 94 KB to 43 KB. The `third_party/` license notice for the bundled Unicode emoji regular expression is still included

## [2.0.1-beta.1] - 2026-08-24

### Added
- Unicode Emoji 17.0 RGI sequence support and a reproducible generator for the emoji regular expression
- AST golden fixtures and serialization-based compatibility tests for detecting unintended parser changes
- Automated version bumping, tagging, pub.dev publishing, GitHub Release creation, and merge-back workflows

### Fixed
- Aligned quote, fenced code block, search, italic, hashtag, URL, and link parsing more closely with mfm.js
- Preserved input and continued parsing after invalid or incomplete syntax fallbacks, including unclosed MFM functions
- Supported CRLF and standalone CR newlines consistently across block parsers
- Rejected empty code nodes and invalid mentions while preserving subsequent valid syntax
- Recognized custom emoji codes that immediately follow alphanumeric characters

## [2.0.0] - 2026-01-23

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Minimum Dart SDK version raised to `^3.8.0` (from `^3.0.0`)
- **BREAKING**: All AST classes migrated to freezed sealed class union pattern
- **BREAKING**: Added `freezed_annotation: ^3.1.0` as a runtime dependency

### Added
- Value equality (`==` and `hashCode`) for all MfmNode types
- `copyWith()` method for immutable updates on all nodes
- Enhanced `toString()` output for debugging
- Dart 3 pattern matching support with exhaustiveness checking

### Removed
- `custom_lint` dev dependency (incompatible with newer analyzer version)

## [1.0.1] - 2026-01-21

The reason for the PUB POINTS being 150 on pub.dev was due to exceeding the 180-character limit in the description.
I shortened part of the explanation to fit within the base character count. There are no changes to the library's functionality with this update.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-21

### Added
- I rewrote the parsing process from scratch using Dart and petitparser, based on mfm-js.
At this stage, the basic parsing functionality is complete.
I plan to create the rendering process using a different library in the future.
